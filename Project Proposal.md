Dear Meta,

Before diving into the scope of this project, I wanted to begin by thanking you for the opportunity to work on such an exciting undertaking. The world of crypto is filled with excitement and room for growth, and I hope to contribute to your ecosystem in a meaningful manner.

It's no secret that at this point, the metaverse is moving into the public's eye. As NFT's skyrocket and crypto assets are on the move, people can't help but notice the movement. I'm sure this comes as no news to you, Meta.

One aspect of this movement that is particularly interesting is the rapidly growing space of NFT art. According to [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/06/nft-trading-volume-hit-10-billion-2-reasons-why-people-are-buying.html), Q3 of 2021 showed an NFT trading volume of $10.67 billion, a 704% increase from the previous quarter. The NFT movement started with an artwork known as CryptoPunks, aimed to be used as a profile picture. Today, these NFT's are rare and go for 6 to 7 figure USD prices.

While NFT's have many use cases and will continue to expand into exciting avenues, this is the one that I want to explore -- the concept of users identifying with their NFT artwork. However, I'd like to take it a step further -- to combine the artwork styling of the user's NFT with a profile picture of their own, to create a mesh of the real world with the metaverse. This will be done by training GAN (Generative Adversarial Networks) architecture to create a human-NFT hybrids.

Below, you will find a high-level blueprint of the project, including its purpose, the data being considered, and some of the tools I will use. Happy to clarify any of the below further on a call.

## **Purpose** - Create NFT-ified Profile Pictures for Crypto-Enthusiast Userbase on Meta

My goal here is to develop a user-friendly tool that can help users combine the NFT's they own with a picture of themselves, adding further value to the NFT they purchased and helping Meta engage with the Crypto community and the future of NFT's.

## **Data Being Examined** - NFT and Profile Picture Combinations 

Various combinations of NFT's that fall under the "Profile Picture" category, and real user Profile Pictures.

## **Data Analysis Tools**
**Numpy** - Data Preparation Tool, specifically for working with arrays  
**Tensorflow** - Deep Neural Network Software library  
**Keras** - Python Library utilized as a interface for TensorFlow   
**Matplotlib** - Data visualization tools 

## **First Deliverable** - MVP Goal
On Monday (11/29) at 6 pm EST, I will deliver my first pass at this project.

Thank you for your trust in me, and I look forward to working together in the coming weeks.

Best,

Michael
